        <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
        <h5>Hey! My name is Olivia.</h5>
        <h5>I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Guelph and 
            am looking for a role in software development, quality assurance, cybersecurity, business analysis, 
            or other related fields.
        </h5>
        <br>
        <h5>On a more personal note...</h5>
        <h5>I was born and raised in Hamilton, ON, Canada.</h5h5>
        <h5>My hobbies include cooking, going to the gym, playing chess, and playing video games.</h5>
        <h5>From a young age, I've been fascinated by computers. Growing up with my father, who is an IT Consultant/Developer, I was surrounded by the 
            latest technology. I adopted computer skills from a very young age, and my hobby of playing PC games led to my passion for computers.
            My father has always been my biggest inspiration to stay curious and to always be learning - something I continue to carry forward.
